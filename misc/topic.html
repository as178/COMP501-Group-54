    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Algorithmic Personalisation in the Digital World and its Effects on
      Society</h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      This topic regards the use of algorithms within frequently used digital systems such as social media platforms,
      online retail websites, businesses' marketing schemes and advertisements, which tailor content and experiences to
      individuals based on their actions, patterns, behaviours and interactions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      This is an extremely significant topic to cover in today's day and age, where the majority of the systems society
      interacts with are intergrated with algorithms, serving to provide more affable and efficient experiences to users
      globally. Adolescents in particular are impacted by these algorithms, as they interact with them the most on a
      daily basis through all of the digital systems mentioned previously.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      However, the importance of algorithmic personalisation extends beyond the effects it has on adolescents as
      individuals, and thus, the presented research aims to cover the effects and implications on society as a whole, as
      well as adolescents. It is imperative to acknowledge that the societal effects these algorithms have on people are
      serious and drastic, as they affect: day-to-day lives, habits, beliefs, mindsets, emotions, actions,
      decision-making, judgement, privacy and knowledge, to name a few crucial areas.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      This website intends to cover, explore and inform the reader about the societal implications
      these algorithms have, through a thorough investigation of the opportunities, risks and choices offered by them
      and their use in the aforementioned digital systems. By doing so, this website equally intends to once more
      highlight the importance of this topic but also examine the versatility of algorithms and their personalisation
      capabilities. The conducted research intends to explore the effects algorithms have on society as a whole,
      with a specific focus on adolescents as individuals, who are impacted the most by algorithmic integration within
      the modern digital world.
