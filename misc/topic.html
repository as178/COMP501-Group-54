      Recommendation Algorithms in the Digital World and
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">
      their Effects on Society & Adolescents
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      This topic regards the use of recommendation algorithms within frequently used digital systems such as social
      media platforms, online retail websites, businesses' marketing schemes and advertisements, which tailor content
      and experiences to individuals based on their actions, patterns, behaviours and interactions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      This is an extremely significant topic to cover in today's day and age, where the majority of the systems society
      interacts with are intergrated with such algorithms, serving to provide more affable and efficient experiences to
      users globally. Adolescents in particular are impacted by these recommendation algorithms, as they interact with
      them the most on a daily basis through all of the digital systems mentioned previously. By doing so, these
      algorithms are able to affect and even dictate a wide range of things including (but not limited to) day-to-day
      lives, habits, beliefs, mindsets, emotions, actions, decision-making, judgement, privacy and knowledge. These
      affected areas within people, and particularly adolescents, are imperative to acknowledge and examine, as
      influencing them via stated algorithms can bring both good and bad consequences for society as a whole.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      Thus, the research within this website intends to highlight the importance of recommendation algorithms and
      their frequently utilised recommendation, personalisation and tailoring capabilities. It explores the many
      societal opportunities, risks and choices that are brought forth through the integration of recommendation
      algorithms within popular digital systems, aiming to provide conclusive information and awareness as to how
      society can navigate today's digital world with these algorithms in mind.
